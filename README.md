# unit-4-game

Why the project is useful:

Welcome to my Crystal Game! 

This project incorporates jQuery/Javascript to create this game concept.

For this particular game, the object is to reach the random number given using a set of 4 crystals. Each crystal is assigned a random number which the user cannot see until the crystal is clicked. Once clicked, the value of the cyrstal is added to your total score. If you go over or under the given number, you lose the game and a new session begins.
